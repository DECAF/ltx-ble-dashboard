BLX.JS, BlueWorker.cs and BLSTORE.JS
====================================
(C) JoEmbedded.de 

BSX: Commands for Terminal (enable Terminal with blx.setTerminal("blxTerminal", bleCallback),
where "blxTerminal" is an empty <div>, see ble_api/index.html

WIN: Commands in BlueWorker.cs

There are 2 types of commands. Commands starting with '.' are interpreted by BLX ('SysCommands', others
are directly sent via BLE to the device. (see 'ltx_ble.c'). Of courese, some commands can be entered
in multiple ways, like "Reset" and ".reset". (Remark: "*" repeats last command (only in Terminal)).

SysCommands (from 'blx.js' -> async function blxSysCmd (cmd)):
--------------------------------------------------------------
.q
.quit 
	BLX: Hide Terminal
	
.cls
	BLX: Clear Terminal
	
.s
.store
	Store Commands (device data stored in indexedDB as Key/Value-Pairs)
	If KEY is empty: use last filename from '.get' as KEY
	
	(No Parameter): List Store (Keys, date, Length)

	c / clear : Clear complete indexDB

	r / remove [KEY]: Remove Key. 
		(example: '.s r F65F6C3B7F1527C1_sys_param.lxp')
		
	l / list [KEY]: List as Text-Lines (Idx: Text)
		(fast show contents of text files: example: '.s l F65F6C3B7F1527C1_sys_param.lxp')

	m / modify Idx NewText [KEY]: Modify Text-Line Idx to NewText (No Spaces allowed)
	    (this is an easy command to modify data in the indexDB, 
		example: '.s m 18 999 F65F6C3B7F1527C1_sys_param.lxp')
		
.e [KEY]
.export [KEY]
	If KEY is empty: use last filename from '.get' as KEY
	Export Key as file ( = "Download" in Browser)
	
.a [[RSSI] TERM]
.audio [[RSSI] TERM]
	List/Set audio flags RSSI and TERM: (set as 0/1):
	RSSI: If 1: Play sound each RSSI paket (low/higher sound: device is farer/nearer)
	TERM: If 0: Terminal is silent
	
.f [[[frq] [dur]] vol]
	Play a sound, Frequency frq (Hz), with dur secs (0..), volume (0..10)
	Example .f 440 2 5
	
.k [CONT]
.keep  [CONT]
	Normally BLE Connectins are terminated after a few minutes, set to keep connection.
	List/Set connection flag CONT (set as 0/1):
	
.rs [SHOW_RSSI]
	List/Set RSSI listing in terminal (in dBm) (set as 0/1):
	
.cf [[VAL_FS] VAL_MEM]
.connectionfast [[VAL_FS] VAL_MEM]
	set/query fast connection speed for fileops and/or memory ops

.l [ANZ]
.lines [ANZ]
	set/query default no of lines in the terminal 
	
.sl MSEC
.sleep MSEC
	Test command - sleep/wait a number of msec
	
.c
.connect
	BLX: Show BLE-Connect Window 
	WIN: Connect last unsed BleAdr

.d
.disconnect
	Disconnect BLE

.r [PIN]
.reconnect [PIN]
	Reconnect (previously terminated) BLE Connection, optionally with a Access PIN

.i [PIN]
.identify [PIN]
	Opt. reconnect (previously terminated) BLE Connection, optionally with a Access PIN
	and identify device
	
.m
.memory
	Calculate available data memory (only for devices with Filesystem)
	
.u
.upload
    Upload data.edt/data.edt.old to store, fastspeed true by default
	(only for devices with Filesystem)
	
.x [MAC]
.xtract [MAC]
	Extract data.edt/data.old for a device to synthesized Key/Value-File in Store
	(for display with Graph-Tool, only for devices with Filesystem). If MAC is empty:
	use last/current device.
	
.g  [..]
.get [..]
	(only for devices with Filesystem)
	Get a file from the device's Filesystem:
    .g FNAME - All 
    .g FNAME pos0 - from pos0 (Middle to End)
    .g FNAME pos0 anz - anz Bytes from pos0 (Only Start of File)

.p [SYNCFLAG]
.put [SYNCFLAG]
	(only for devices with Filesystem)
	Select File and send it to device's Filesystem. If SYNCFLAG set to 1: Set Syncflag in Filesystem

.memput
	Select File and send it to device's Memory (only for small files, see LTX docu)	

.fput KEY
	(only for devices with Filesystem)
	Send a File from indexDB (KEY) to device's Filesystem
	
.del FNAME	
	(only for devices with Filesystem)
	Delet FNAME on the device's Filesystem
	
.format TYP
	(only for devices with Filesystem)
	Format Filesystem. ALL DATA will be lost!
	TYP 1 is HARD-FORMAT (always slow)
	TYP 2 (recommended) is SOFT-FORMAT (faster, only slow if Filesystem was very full)

.firmware
	(only for devices with Filesystem)
	Upload a Secureed Firmware Image ('.sec') to the device and install it (will terminate BLE connection)
	
.reset
	Reset device (will terminate BLE connection)

.t [set]
.time [set]
	Querry ('.t') or set ('.t set') RTC on device


.devicelist
	WIN: Show DeviceList/Cache
