# BlxDashboard : Using Web Bluetooth to access LTX Data Loggers #
** A PWA (Progressive Web APP) for accessing LTX Data Loggers with BLE, LTE-M. LTE-NB, EDGE, EGPRS, Satellite, ...  

__Web Bluetooth__ is an official __W3C API__, integrated in most modern Browsers (like Chrome, Edge, Opera, …)
on Android and Windows. So it is now very easy to connect to Bluetooth devices 
with one single software with Desktops/Notebooks (Windows), as well as with Smartphones/Tablets (Android and Windows)! 
_(Unfortunately the Web Bluetooth API is still not fully available on Safari (iOS), but workarounds exists, using a Wrapper-App with a WebViewer )._

It is even not necessary to install any 'native APP'! The complete software is nothing else, than a _„Simple Web page“_, that can work even offline (is installed)! Extremely convenient and safe!

### Installation as PWA (Progressive Web APP) (for offline use):

Automatic installation
- Simply Click on ` Install APP `

Fallback (manuall installation):
- On Android smartphones: Select `Add to home screen`
- On desktop PCs: In the browser, select the 3-dot menu (right side): `Stream, save, share` -> `Install as APP`
